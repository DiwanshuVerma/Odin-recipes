    <div class="recipe">
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>200g paneer, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cashews, soaked in warm water for 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh cream (you can use heavy cream or malai)</li>
            <li>1-inch ginger, grated</li>
            <li>3-4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>2-3 green cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey or sugar (optional, for a hint of sweetness)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>In a blender, make a smooth paste of soaked cashews along with chopped tomatoes, grated ginger, and minced
            garlic. You can add a splash of water if needed.</li>

        <li>Heat ghee or vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, green cardamom pods, and bay leaf.
            Saut√© for a minute until the spices release their aroma.</li>

        <li>Add the chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent and slightly brown.</li>

        <li>Now, pour in the cashew-tomato paste and cook it on medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Cook until the oil
            starts to separate from the gravy, and it thickens.</li>

        <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt to the gravy. Mix well and cook for another
            couple of minutes.</li>

        <li>Gradually add the milk and fresh cream to the gravy, stirring continuously to combine everything well. If
            the gravy becomes too thick, you can adjust the consistency by adding a little water.</li>

        <li>Add the paneer cubes to the gravy and gently mix them in, ensuring they are well coated with the sauce. Let
            it simmer for a few minutes, allowing the paneer to soak in the flavors.</li>

        <li>Crush the kasuri methi between your palms and sprinkle it over the gravy for a delightful aroma.</li>

        <li>If you prefer a slightly sweet taste, you can add a tablespoon of honey or sugar at this stage (optional).
        </li>

        <li>Finally, garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
    </ol>
