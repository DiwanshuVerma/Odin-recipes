        <h3>Here's a simple recipe to make a delicious cup of masala chai:</h3>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons black tea leaves (or 2 tea bags)</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>3-4 green cardamom pods, crushed</li>
            <li>1-inch piece of fresh ginger, grated</li>
            <li>2-3 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 small cinnamon stick or 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>A pinch of black peppercorns (optional)</li>
            <li>A pinch of nutmeg (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Crush the whole spices: Using a mortar and pestle or the back of a spoon, lightly crush the green
                cardamom pods and cloves to release their flavors.</li>

            <li>Boil water and spices: In a saucepan, add the water, crushed spices, grated ginger, cinnamon stick,
                black peppercorns (if using), and nutmeg (if using). Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it
                simmer for 5-7 minutes. This allows the spices to infuse their flavors into the water.</li>

            <li>Add the tea: Add the black tea leaves or tea bags to the saucepan and simmer for an additional 2-3
                minutes. If you prefer a stronger tea, you can simmer it for a little longer.</li>

            <li>Add milk and sugar: Pour in the milk and add the sugar to the saucepan. Stir well and let the chai come
                to a gentle boil. Keep an eye on it to prevent overflowing.</li>

            <li>Strain and serve: Once the chai has reached your desired strength and consistency, turn off the heat.
                Using a fine mesh strainer or a tea strainer, pour the chai into cups to remove the spices and tea
                leaves.</li>
        </ol>
